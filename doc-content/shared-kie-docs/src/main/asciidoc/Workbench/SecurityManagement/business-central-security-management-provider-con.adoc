= Security management providers

In the context of security management, a realm restricts access to different application resources. Realms contain information about the users, groups, roles, and permissions. A concrete user and group management service implementation for a specific realm is called a security management provider.

If the built-in security management providers do not fit with your application security realm, then you can build and register your own security management provider.

NOTE: If the security management provider is not installed, the user interface for managing the security realm will not be available. After you install and configure a security management provider, the user and group management features are automatically enabled in the security management user interface.
