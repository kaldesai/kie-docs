= Security management

Security management is the process of managing users, groups, and permissions. You can control the access to {CENTRAL} resources and features from the {CENTRAL} Security management page.

{CENTRAL} defines three types of entities for security management: users, groups, and roles. You can assign permissions to both roles and groups. Users inherit permissions from the groups and roles that the user is a member of.
