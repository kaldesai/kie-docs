= Security management

Security management describes how you can manage the users, groups, and permissions with the help of user interface in order to configure who can access the different available resources and features.

You control access to {CENTRAL} resources and features by managing users, groups, and permissions from the {CENTRAL} Security management page. {CENTRAL} defines three types of entities for security management: users, groups, and roles. You can assign permissions to both roles and groups. Users inherit permissions from the groups and roles that the user is a member of.
