= Feature comparison of legacy and new test scenario designer

{PRODUCT} currently supports both the new *Test Scenarios* designer and the former *Test Scenarios (Legacy)* designer.

The default designer is the new test scenarios designer, which supports testing of both rules and DMN models and provides an enhanced overall user experience with test scenarios. If required, you can continue to use the legacy test scenarios designer, which supports rule-based test scenarios only.

IMPORTANT: The legacy Test Scenarios tool was deprecated with {PRODUCT} 7.3.0. It will be removed in a future {PRODUCT} release. Use the new Test Scenarios designer instead.

The following table highlights the main features of legacy and new test scenario designer which are supported in {PRODUCT} to help you decide the suitable test scenarios designer in your project.

* `+` indicates that the feature is present in the test scenario designer.
* `-` indicates that the feature is not present in the test scenario designer.

a|*Creating and running a test scenario*

* You can create test scenarios in {CENTRAL} to test the functionality of business rule data before deployment.
* A basic test scenario must have at least a related data objects, *GIVEN* facts or *EXPECT* results.
* You can run the tests to validate your business rules and data.

a|*Adding GIVEN facts in test scenarios*

a|*Adding EXPECT results in test scenarios*

* It represents the objects and their fields whose exact values are checked based on the given information.
* The *EXPECT* section defines the expected results based on the *GIVEN* input facts.

a|*Globals*

* Global variables are named objects that are visible to the decision engine but are different from the objects for facts.
* Global variables are deprecated for new test scenarios.
* In case you want to reuse data sets for different scenarios, you can use the *Background* instance.

a|*CALL METHOD*

* You can use this to invoke a method from another fact when the rule execution is initiated.
* You can invoke any Java class methods from the Java library or from a JAR that was imported for the project.

a|*Modify an existing fact*

* You can modify a previously inserted fact in the decision engine between executions of the scenario.

a|*Bound variable*

* Sets the value of the field to the fact bound to a selected variable.
* In new test scenario designer, you can not define a variable inside test scenario grid and reuse it inside *GIVEN* or *EXPECTED* cells
