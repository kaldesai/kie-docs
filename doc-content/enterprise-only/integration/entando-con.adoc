= Entando Digital Experience Platform (DXP) and App Builder

Entando Digital Experience Platform (DXP) is a low-code, component-based platform for building modern web, mobile, and IoT applications. The App Builder is an application that provides features to help you configure and customize, with or without programming skills, any kind of modern web application built with the App Builder Platform. The App Builder is a web-based administration console that you can use to build and configure your web application, manage your page data and activities, and integrate with other application tools, such as {PRODUCT}.

The basic components for building applications in App Builder are page models that define page layout and application widgets that define page data and functionality.
