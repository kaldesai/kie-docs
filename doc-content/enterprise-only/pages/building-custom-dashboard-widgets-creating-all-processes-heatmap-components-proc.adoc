= Creating processes heatmap components

You can create heatmap components for multiple processes in {CENTRAL}.

.Prerequisites

* {KIE_SERVER} is deployed and connected to {CENTRAL}.
* You have created a project in {CENTRAL} and it contains at least one business process asset.
* A project with a process definition has been deployed in {CENTRAL}.
* Sample process instances are created.

.Procedure

. Start {CENTRAL}, go to *Menu → Design → Pages*.
. In the *Pages* panel, click *New*.
. In the *New Page* dialog box, enter a value in the *Name* field and select the required style.
. Click *OK*. The new page opens in the *Page Editor*.
+
You can see that *Heatmaps* component is available under *Components* panel.
. Click *Save*.
. To create a new {KIE_SERVER} dataset, complete the following steps:
... In {CENTRAL}, go to *Admin → Data Sets*.
+
The *Data Set Explorer* page opens.
... Click *New Data Set* and select the *Execution Server* provider type.
+
The *Data Set Creation Wizard* page opens.
... Enter the name of the dataset.
... Select the server configuration. It is available if you have deployed the project.
... Select the query target from the list.
... In the *Query* field, enter the following custom SQL query.

   pil.externalId,
   pil.processId,
    nid,
    nodetype,
    nodename,
    count(nid) as total_hits,
    avg(execution_time) as averageExecutionTime,
    min(execution_time) as minExecutionTime,
    max(execution_time) as maxExecutionTime
from(
        select
                max(log_date) as lastLog,
                processinstanceid as piid,
                nodeinstanceid as niid,
                nodeid as nid,
                nodetype,
                nodename,
                DATEDIFF(SECOND, min(log_date), max(log_date)) as execution_time
        from
                NodeInstanceLog
        group by
              processinstanceid,
               nodeinstanceid
       order by lastLog
)
inner join
     ProcessInstanceLog pil on pil.processInstanceId = piid
group by
     pil.externalId,
     nid

... Complete the *Data Set Creation Wizard* and click *Test*.
... Click *Save*.
. Return to *Menu → Design → Pages*.
. In the *Components* panel, expand the *Heatmaps* components and drag the *All Processes Heatmaps* component type to the canvas.
. In the *Displayer editor* wizard, click *Data* tab and select the newly created {KIE_SERVER} dataset.
. In the *Data* tab, select *EXTERNALID*, *PROCESSID*, *NID*, and *AVERAGEEXECUTIONTIME* from the *Columns* field.
. In the *Process Selector* box, select the *Container* and *Process* values as per your requirement.
. Click *Display* tab and edit the following values as per your requirements:
* *Chart*
* *Margins*
* *Filter*
* *Refresh*
