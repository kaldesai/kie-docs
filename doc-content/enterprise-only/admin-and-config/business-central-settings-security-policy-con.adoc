= Security policy

Every application contains a single security policy which is used every time the system checks a permission. The set of permissions assigned to every role and/or group is called the security policy.

The security policy file is stored in the `WEB-INF/classes/security-policy.properties` under the application's `WAR` file structure.

NOTE: If the security policy is not defined then the security management feature is disabled and the application as if all the resources and features are granted by default.

.Example security policy file template

----
# Role "admin"
role.admin.permission.perspective.read=true
role.admin.permission.perspective.read.Dashboard=false

# Role "user"
role.user.permission.perspective.read=false
role.user.permission.perspective.read.Home=true
role.user.permission.perspective.read.Dashboard=true
----

Every entry defines a single permission which is assigned to a role or group. When an application starts, the policy file is loaded and stored into memory.
